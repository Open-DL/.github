This organization is maintained by [Kamal](https://www.kamalmalik.com) and [Erfan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erfan-dvnz/). We are two best friends, currently based out of Toronto 🇨🇦 and London 🇬🇧. 

We’re deep learning enthusiasts dedicated to sharing our knowledge and advancing the field. We created this GitHub organization to provide a platform for collaborative and innovative work in AI and to make our open-source deep learning projects available to the public to foster learning, research, and development. 

We aim to build in public ⚒️ and share our learnings 📚 for the world to see. 

🎯 Our goal is simple – to make deep learning content accessible and to provide a platform for individuals to learn.
